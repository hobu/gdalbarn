# *GDAL Coordinate System Barn Raising*

Drastic improvement of coordinate systems is needed for the
[GDAL](http://gdal.org), [PROJ](https://proj4.org),
[libgeotiff](https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff), [PostGIS](http://postgis.net), and
[Spatialite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index) open source
toolchain. Three significant issues must be improved, and no single
organization has shown the wherewithal to step forward and financially support
an infrastructure effort this big on its own.  The community needs to come
together for a [barn raising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_raising).

Our target funding goal has been reached on May 15th 2018, which will enable us
to start work on this challenging task. See [Who](#who) to
