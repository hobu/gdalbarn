# *GDAL Coordinate System Barn Raising*

Drastic improvement of coordinate systems is needed for the
[GDAL](http://gdal.org), [PROJ](https://proj4.org),
[libgeotiff](https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff), [PostGIS](http://postgis.net), and
[Spatialite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index) open source
toolchain. Three significant issues must be improved, and no single
organization has shown the wherewithal to step forward and financially support
an infrastructure effort this big on its own.  The community needs to come
together for a [barn raising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_raising).

To date, $94,500 has been pledged – 76% of the total – of $125,000 needed by
June 4th, 2018 to start work on this challenging task. See [Who](#who) to
learn who has already sponsored, and keep scrolling to learn more about the work.
