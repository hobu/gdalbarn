# *GDAL Coordinate System Barn Raising*

Drastic improvement of coordinate systems is needed for the
[GDAL](http://gdal.org), [PROJ](https://proj4.org),
[libgeotiff](https://trac.osgeo.org/geotif), [PostGIS](http://postgis.net), and
[Spatialite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index) open source
toolchain. Three significant issues must be improved, and no single
organization has shown the wherewithal to step forward and financially support
an infrastructure effort this big on its own.  The community needs to come
together for a [barn raising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_raising).

To date, $62,000 has been pledged – 49% of the goal – of the $125,000 needed by
June 4th, 2018. See [Who](#who) to sponsor.
