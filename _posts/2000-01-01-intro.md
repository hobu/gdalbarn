# *[GDAL](http://gdal.org) Coordinate System Barn Raising*

Drastic improvement of coordinate systems is needed for the GDAL, PROJ,
libgeotiff, PostGIS, and Spatialite open source toolchain. Three significant
issues must be improved, and no single organization has shown the wherewithal to step
forward and financially support an infrastructure effort this big on its own.
The community needs to come together for a [barn
raising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_raising).

We are raising funds to support the improvement, enhancement, and maintenance
of GDAL, PROJ, and related projects on the topic of coordinate systems
capabilities and definitions. To date, $55,000 has been pledged – 44% of the
goal – of the $125,000 needed by June 4th, 2018. See [Who](#who) to
sponsor.
