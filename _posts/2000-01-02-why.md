Coordinate systems in [GDAL](http://gdal.org), [PROJ](https://proj4.org), and
[libgeotiff](https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/) are fragile, missing
capabilities, and need a thorough refactoring:

* The dreaded ad hoc CSV databases in `PROJ_LIB` and `GDAL_DATA` PROJ and GDAL can get
out of sync, out of date, and are hard to manage.

* GDAL and PROJ are missing [OGC WKT2](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html) support.

* PROJ 5.0+ no longer requires datum transformation pivoting through WGS84, but
the rest of the tools cannot yet take advantage of it.

## CSV database

The use of a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)-based database for EPSG and
other definitions will allow the projects to add more capability, transition the
custom peculiar data structures of the projects to something more universally
consumable, and promote definition interoperability between many coordinate system
handling software tools.

## WKT2

[OGC WKT2](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html)  fixes some longstanding interoperability coordinate system definition
discrepancies.  A huge benefit of WKT2 is that it contains tools for describing
time-dependent coordinate reference systems. PROJ 5+ is now capable of
time-dependent transformations.  The combination makes it possible to use
time-dependent CRSs.  This is becoming ever more important these days with
several countries updating their geodetic infrastructure to include such
systems. At the moment the most notable examples are the Australians who will
be switching to a ["dynamic
datum"](http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/positioning-navigation/datum-modernisation)
in 2020. [New reference
frames](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/newdatums/index.shtml) will be
introduced in the United States in 2022. Two new systems will be introduced
that replaces NAD83 and NAVD88. The new systems are called NATRF2022 and
NAPGD2022 and both will be fully time-dependent. The industry **WILL** have to
adapt to these challenges sooner or later.

# WGS84 Pivot

PROJ previously required datum transformation that pivoted through WGS84. PROJ 5.0.0
removed this restriction, and the opportunity to support late-binding transforms through
[PROJ kinematic shifting functions](https://proj4.org/operations/transformations/deformation.html) is
now viable. This makes it possible to achieve higher accuracy in transformations -
and hence your data in general (because of on-the-fly transformations in GIS etc.) -
because the active use of the EPSG database will allow us to construct a more
accurate transformation between two systems. The important part here is that we
can avoid stepping through WGS84 in the transformation. Using WGS84 as a hub
datum introduces a ~2m uncertainty on all your transformed data. Avoiding that
should be valuable to many people.
