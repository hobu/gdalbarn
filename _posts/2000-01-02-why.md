Coordinate systems in [GDAL](http://gdal.org), [PROJ](https://proj4.org), and
[libgeotiff](https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/) are fragile, missing
capabilities, and need a thorough refactoring:

* The dreaded `PROJ_LIB` and `GDAL_DATA` CSV files for PROJ and GDAL can get out of sync, out of date, and are hard to manage. The opportunity to add more capability means overcoming this ad hoc database.

* GDAL and PROJ are missing [OGC WKT2](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html) support. WKT2
fixes some longstanding coordinate system definition discrepancies.

* PROJ previously required datum transformation that pivoted through WGS84. PROJ 5.0.0
removed this restriction, and the opportunity to support late-binding transforms through
[PROJ kinematic shifting functions](https://proj4.org/operations/transformations/deformation.html) is
now viable.
