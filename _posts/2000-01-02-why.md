Coordinate systems in [GDAL](http://gdal.org), [PROJ](https://proj4.org), and
[libgeotiff](https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/) are missing modern capabilities
and need a thorough refactoring:

* The dreaded ad hoc CSV databases in `PROJ_LIB` and `GDAL_DATA` are frustrating
for users and pose challenges for developers.

* GDAL and PROJ are missing [OGC WKT2](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html) support.

* PROJ 5.0+ no longer requires datum transformation pivoting through WGS84, which
  can introduce errors of up to 2m, but the rest of the tools cannot yet take
  advantage of it.

## CSV database

The use of a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)-based database for
EPSG and other definitions will allow the projects to add more capability
(area-aware validation), transition the custom peculiar data structures of the
projects to something more universally consumable, and promote definition
interoperability between many coordinate system handling software tools.

## WKT2

[OGC WKT2](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html)  fixes
longstanding interoperability coordinate system definition discrepancies.
WKT2 contains tools for describing time-dependent coordinate reference systems.
PROJ 5+ is now capable of time-dependent transformations, but GDAL and other
tools do not yet support them.

Several countries are updating their geodetic infrastructure to include
time-dependent coordinate systems. [Australia](http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/positioning-navigation/datum-modernisation)
in 2020 and the [United States](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/newdatums/index.shtml) are
adapting time-dependent coordinate systems in 2020 and 2022, respectively,
with the familiar NAD83 and NAVD88 in North America being replaced by `NATRF2022` and `NAPGD2022`.
The industry **WILL** have to adapt to these challenges
sooner or later.

# WGS84 Pivot

PROJ previously required datum transformation that pivoted through WGS84 via a
7-parameter transform.  This pivot is a practical solution, but it can
introduce error of about two meters, and many legacy datums cannot be defined
in terms of WGS84. PROJ 5.0.0 now provides the tools to support late-binding
through its [transformation pipeline
framework](https://proj4.org/usage/transformation.html#geodetic-transformation),
but GDAL and the rest of the tools cannot use it yet. Higher accuracy
transformations avoid stepping through WGS84 and eliminate extra
transformation steps with side-car data from a local geodetic authority.
