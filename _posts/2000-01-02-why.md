Coordinate systems in [GDAL](http://gdal.org), [PROJ](https://proj4.org), and
[libgeotiff](https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/) are fragile, missing
capabilities, and need a thorough refactoring:

* The dreaded `PROJ_LIB` and `GDAL_DATA` CSV files for PROJ and GDAL can get
out of sync, out of date, and are hard to manage. The opportunity to add more
capability means overcoming this ad hoc database.

* GDAL and PROJ are missing [OGC WKT2](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html) support. WKT2
fixes some longstanding coordinate system definition discrepancies.
A huge benefit of WKT2 is that it contains tools for describing time-dependent
coordinate reference systems. PROJ is now capable of time-dependent transformations.
The combination of the two will make it possible to use time-dependent CRSs.
This is becoming ever more important these days with several countries updating
their geodetic infrastructure to include such systems. At the moment the most
notable examples are the Australians who will be switching to a
["dynamic datum"](http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/positioning-navigation/datum-modernisation)
in 2020. [New reference frames](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/newdatums/index.shtml)
will be introduced in the United States in 2022. Two new systems will be introduced
that replaces NAD83 and NAVD88. The new systems are called NATRF2022 and NAPGD2022
and both will be fully time-dependent. This is something the industry WILL have
to adapt sooner or later.

* PROJ previously required datum transformation that pivoted through WGS84. PROJ 5.0.0
removed this restriction, and the opportunity to support late-binding transforms through
[PROJ kinematic shifting functions](https://proj4.org/operations/transformations/deformation.html) is
now viable. This makes it possible to achieve higher accuracy in transformations -
and hence your data in general (because of on-the-fly transformations in GIS etc.) -
because the active use of the EPSG database will allow us to construct a more
accurate transformation between two systems. The important part here is that we
can avoid stepping through WGS84 in the transformation. Using WGS84 as a hub 
datum introduces a ~2m uncertainty on all your transformed data. Avoiding that
should be valuable to many people.
