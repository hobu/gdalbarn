# Sponsors

The effort currently has generous sponsorship from 16 organizations. We are
still short of our goal of $125,000 by June 4th, 2018 to be able to start work
on this effort. To keep invoicing and transfer churn low, we are asking for
minimum contributions of $1,000USD. Without support from our sponsors, this work
will never be completed.

Starting 11-MAY-2018, [Safe Software](https://safe.com) is dollar-for-dollar matching contributions up
to $20,000USD. To date, $9,000 of match is still available. Make your contribution double count by letting us know your pledge!
